    <p align=center>
     on One Fine Day
    </p>
    <p class="subject">


<font color="blue"> 9:30 AM</font>: Magazine work starts usually late. 9:30, or even 10:00.
               Don't envy this cause there are tons of overtime shifts! <br/>

<font color="blue">10:00 AM</font>: We hold an item meeting once a month. Usually, it's for what subject to write for upcoming month,
                and also share the feedbacks with other for improvements. <br/>

<font color="blue">12:00PM</font>: On the week of deadline we work our ass off, but usually, our lunch time is free!
                I spend my time making personal meetings, meet with public relations agencies, share working stories and tec. <br/>

<font color="blue">14:00 PM</font>: Going to shooting! When I shoot outside, I can go to the destination comfortably by company car if I apply for dispatch!
                It would have been terrible if I had to take a cab with both hands full of shooting props. <br/>

<font color="blue">  15:00 PM</font>: Picture shoot & interview with an actor who just recently filmed.
                At first, I loved how I could meet good-looking celebrites. Now, it's just a work. <br/>

<font color="blue">  19:00 PM</font>: Usually I get off after shoothing but...when there are branding events, can't miss!
                After taking pictures of all the celebrities who came and post them on SNS, my day is done!

<p class="introduction">
You have just read a schedule of Fashion Editor, who is my cousin, Jisoo Kim. She works at Bazaar Korea, a fashion magazine conmpany. <br/>
I chose her to interview with because I was always interested in the process of publishing fashion magazine, and how they work with both fashion and literature.

So, what do you do as an editor?
    </p>
    <p class="subject">
      Usually, magazines are divided into fashion, beauty, and each team has two ~ three editors.<br/>
      In general, you are in charge of 5 ~ 10 articles per month, and you should finish recruiting team (photographer, stylist, etc.),<br/>
      shooting, interviewing, and writing <a href="https://hub.wiley.com/community/exchanges/discover/blog/2016/02/02/choosing-the-right-journal-for-your-manuscript-4-steps-to-finding-the-right-fit">manuscript</a>. <br/>
    </p>

    <p class="interviewer">
    How intense the work is?
    </p>
    <p class="subject">
    The work intensity of the magazine is based on the deadline. Generally, fashion finishes are around 15 days a month.<br/>
    One week before deadline is almost an endless repetition of early morning work or night shift.<br/>
    Of course, you should go to work on weekends too.
    However, for about a week after the deadline, you can finally breathe and even can spend a day or two off.<br/>
    </p>

    <p class="interviewer">
  What's the <a href="https://www.vogue.it/en/magazine/editor-s-blog/2011/01/january-26th">hiring process</a>? How do people get hired?
    </p>

    <p class="subject">
    Company that draw people through open recruitment? Very few! It's usually a system that you get hired after
    start working as an assistant or guest reporter, with poor salary, if you are lucky. <br/>
    Lot's of people start through an assistant introduction, and I also heard that people see assistant job announcements coming up in some portal sites. <br/>
   </p>

<p class="interviewer">
What kind of personality do you prefer as an editor?
</p>

<p class="subject">
  Strong physical strength is a must. It is important to maintain a decent mental condition even after staying up all night due to working.
  There are so many assistants who run away ... When you move your job, the editor's article portfolio is important. <br/>
 The most important thing is to turn in the manuscript in the deadline,
 do not art alone, and have the flexibility to meet the needs of the organization. That's just how we get paid...!<br/>
