<h2>Assignment 1 </h2>
    <p>For our first assignment, I teamed up with Jiwoo and Yeasun as a group. <br/>
     At first, we came up with an idea of using arrows. The rules at the first round were :
<ol>
  <li> With each color assigned, draw arrows in clock wise.</li>
  <li> Draw arrow starting from the corner of arrow that was drawn previously, and it should be bent once.</li>
  <li> Only red could intersect with other lines </li>
  <li> When the red intersects, should draw dots around. </li>
  <li> When the colors of blue and green run out of the space, including red, it stops. </li>
</ol>
    </p>

  <br/>
  <p>  With these rules, we struggled remembering what arrow was drawn right before.<br/>
    So the order got messed up and was very confused to draw arrow following the rule. <br/>
    Also, the pen we used were very thin so it was not much visible. <br/>
    Followings are the second exercise rules:
<ol>
    <li>Regardless of knowing that latest arrow drawn, draw arrows from the colors stated; Red from [Black/ Black from Blue/ Blue from Red] </li>
    <li>The arrow should only be bent once</li>
    <li>Only Red could intersect the other lines </li>
    <li>When the red intersects, should draw dots around the intersection. </li>
    <li>When the colors of Blue and Black run out of the space to draw, it ends </li>
</ol>
</p>
