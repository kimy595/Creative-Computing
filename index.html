<h2>Assignment 1 </h2>
    <p>For our first assignment, I teamed up with Jiwoo and Yeasun as a group. <br/>
     At first, we came up with an idea of using arrows. The rules at the first round were :
<ol>
  <li> With each color assigned, draw arrows in clock wise.</li>
  <li> Draw arrow starting from the corner of arrow that was drawn previously, and it should be bent once.</li>
  <li> Only red could intersect with other lines </li>
  <li> When the red intersects, should draw dots around. </li>
  <li> When the colors of blue and green run out of the space, including red, it stops. </li>
</ol>
    </p>

    <img src="images/First Trial.jpg" alt="first trial">
  <br/>
  <p>  With these rules, we struggled remembering what arrow was drawn right before.<br/>
    So the order got messed up and was very confused to draw arrow following the rule. <br/>
    Also, the pen we used were very thin so it was not much visible. <br/>
    Followings are the second exercise rules:
<ol>
    <li>Regardless of knowing that latest arrow drawn, draw arrows from the colors stated; Red from [Black/ Black from Blue/ Blue from Red] </li>
    <li>The arrow should only be bent once</li>
    <li>Only Red could intersect the other lines </li>
    <li>When the red intersects, should draw dots around the intersection. </li>
    <li>When the colors of Blue and Black run out of the space to draw, it ends </li>
</ol>

<h2> Assignment 2 </H2>
  <p>
    I interviewed my uncle, <strong>Joongdo Kim </strong> for this assignment. <br/>
    He is a semiconductor researcher and developer at Samsung.<br/>
    I chose to interview him because he was the only expert that I known of, <br/>
    and I thought it would be interesting to learn about something that I had no knowledge before. <br/>
 </p>
<p>
  <strong> Me</strong>: Hi, Thank you for participating this interview. <br/>
  <strong> JD </strong>: No problem <br/>
  <strong> Me</strong>: So, please explain about semiconductor. What is semiconductor?<br/>
  <strong> JD </strong>: Well, before we think of what semiconductor is, I will explain what is conductor and non-conductor first.</br>
        Conductor is a material that flows well with electricity or heat, such as iron, wire, aluminum, and gold.<br/>
        Conversely, non-conductor is a material that does not flow electricity or heat such as glass, ceramics, and plastic.<br/>
        In electrical engineering, the degree of electricity flow is called <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-electrical-conductivity-605064">"electrical conductivity"</a>.<br/>
        Conductors have a very high electrical conductivity, while insulators are almost zero. <br/>
        Then, what do you think semiconductor would be?? </br>
  <strong> Me</strong>: Um... a material that's in somewhere between two..? Or combined. </br>
  <strong> JD </strong>: Quite right! It's a substance with intermediate propertie between conductor and non-conductor(insulator). <br/>
  <strong> Me</strong>: Okay. So what's the significancy of semiconductor? What's its <strong>main role</strong>? <br/>
  <strong> JD </strong>: It acts as the brain of the machine. That is, it functions to store,calculate,infer and judge everything.<br/>
          It plays a key role in all electronic and mechanical products.<br/>
          The competent semiconductor has the merit that it is easy to control the property of material
          according to what kind of artificial manipulation is done.<br/>
  <strong> Me</strong>: So it bascially takes the ledership of the signals in products.<br/>
  <strong> JD </strong>: Correct.<br/>
  <strong> Me</strong>: What do you mean by the artificial manipulation?? </br>
  <strong> JD </strong>: Pure semiconductor almost dosen't electrify such as non-conductor. </br>
          But when it's subjected to any kind of artificial manipulation, such as application of light or heat,
          injection of certain impurity, electricity flows like conductor. </br>
          Conductors are well-run but difficult to control.</br>
          However, semiconductors have the advantage of easy control </br>
          of the properties of materials depending on what kind of artificial manipulation is applied. </br>

  <strong> Me</strong>: Wow. I guess it has great potential inherented. Then how does its speed determined?<br/>
  <strong> JD </strong>: Um, it's quite complicated. The main thing is to optimize the semiconductor's circuit design.<br/>
  <strong> Me</strong>: What do you mean by optimizing?<br/>
  <strong> JD </strong>: When there are high number of electron that's responsible for the speed, the speed increases.<br/>
          Which we say as'the charge density becomes high'. Then, as the mobility of the charge gets higher,<br/>
          the semiconductor's speed gets faster.<br/>
          There are so many factors that affect the density and mobility of this charge that I can't even explain right now,<br/>
          but the most important thing is that you have to design a semiconductor circuit well.<br/>
          When making a semiconductor circuit, it's important to make them not interfere with each other. </br>
          One of the material we use is called <a href="https://briefs.techconnect.org/papers/low-transmission-loss-flexible-substrates-using-low-dk-df-polyimide-adhesives/">low Dk</a>. </br>
   <strong> Me</strong>: What is the status of future semiconductor industry that you are looking forward to? </br>
   <strong> JD </strong>: Being the brain of every electronic and mechanical product is itself the greatest value of semiconductors.</br>
          So it will be an integral part of artificial intelligence, robots, autonomous vehicles, and supercomputing.</br>
          This means it has intimite relationship with <a href="http://www.advancedmp.com/nanotechnology-semiconductors/">Nanotechnology</a>.</br>
          It's a essential technology to make semiconductor smaller, faster, and outstanding.</br>
   <strong> Me</strong>: Howcome?</br>
   <strong> JD </strong>: Future devices shrink. As they become smaller, semiconductor also shrinks.</br>
          Nowadays, tecnology is so developed that the the distance between the circuit and the circuit that it's less than a mm.</br>
          We could say semiconductor is typical instance of nanotechnology.</br>
   <strong> Me</strong>: Wow that's another really interesting part! I feel like I've learned something that's very scientific for the first time in a while.</br>
   <strong> JD </strong>: Haha.</br>
   <strong> Me</strong>: Thank you so much for the interview. It's been a great help.</br>
   <strong> JD </strong>: Sure! Thanks for having me.</br>
